  I grew up in Wuxi, a relatively small (nickname "little Shanghai") but definitely beautiful and fast-developing city in eastern China. With the desire to explore the unknown and various interesting parts of the world, I went to Carleton College in the U.S. for my undergraduate education. The four-year experience of living and studying in Northfield, Minnesota is such an inspiring, meaningful and memorable journey for me both mentally and physically. I obtained my B.A. degree in both Statistics and Political Science and graduated with Magna Cum Laude in 2022. My senior theses in both disciplines (advised by Dr. Andy Poppick and Dr. Greg Marfleet) received the honor of distinctions. 
  
  Currently I am a second-year M.S. student in Statistical Science at Duke University. In addition to my rigorous coursework, I have actively collaborated on research projects under the guidance of Dr. Alexander Volfovsky and Dr. Hwanhee Hong. These academic experiences have ignited my passion for exploring intricate topics, including ideal point estimation methods, the practical applications and diagnostics of Bayesian hierarchical modeling, and the complexities of causal inference problems. I am acutely aware of the boundless knowledge and challenges that lie ahead in these expansive fields, which continually drive me to dedicate unwavering effort to my academic pursuits.
  
  Apart from academic work, my hobbies are karate, cooking, volunteer work and book preservation. The last skill came from my three years of working as a part-time student preservation assistant at the Laurence McKinley Gould Library:)
