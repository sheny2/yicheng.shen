Poor air quality is a major environmental health threat. Even short-term exposure to poor air quality—such as during extreme pollution events—can cause severe respiratory distress. While there have been significant decreases in Minnesota air pollution levels over the past 40 years, the summer of 2021 upset this trend with Hennepin County reporting the highest particulate measure in the past 20 years. This study focuses on analyzing the extreme values of pollutant concentration levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and fine inhalable particles (PM2.5) across three Minnesota counties as collected by the Environmental Protection Agency from 1980 to 2021. We employ extreme value analysis methods to fit the pollutant data. The models find that SO2 levels have fallen substantially since 1980 in accordance with EPA policies regulating diesel fuel and coal power plants. This dramatic decrease has made the magnitude of severe pollution incidents appear far more extreme than in earlier decades, with typical events in the 1980-1990s often equating to one in a hundred year events today. By contrast, no downward trend in PM2.5 levels was observed over the past 20 years, an expected result given that PM2.5 has more varied sources and is therefore harder to regulate than SO2. However, models show a significant seasonal trend with peaks during winter months, revealing this past ‘summer of smoke’ as particularly extreme.
