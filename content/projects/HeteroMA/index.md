We focus on building a better understanding on the between-study heterogeneity in meta-analysis using the Cochrane library database. The framework of frequentist as well as Bayesian meta-analysis has been frequently employed in various situations, for example testing the efficacy of drugs in randomized trials. There are, however, different meta-analyses methods available to employ, each of the following comes with different modeling assumptions regarding heterogeneity. The models considered are: frequentist fixed effect model with inverse variance, frequentist random effects model with random variance, Bayesian logistic regression model with common treatment effect, Bayesian logistic regression model with heterogeneous treatment effects, Bayesian hierarchical model with Beta prior with common treatment effect, Bayesian hierarchical model with Beta prior with heterogeneous treatment effect, and Bayesian arm-based models. This work will summarize findings from 23,492 meta-analyses with binary outcomes and 10,118 meta-analyses with continuous outcomes from the Cochrane library database.
