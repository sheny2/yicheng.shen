Network meta-analysis (NMA) has become a popular tool for simultaneously evaluating multiple interventions in biomedical studies. However, performing power analysis in NMAs can be challenging as network structures alter and expand. In this study, we investigate power analysis primarily in Bayesian NMAs using simulations and real-world case studies. We first conduct a comprehensive simulation study to examine the properties of power in various NMA scenarios, including different sample sizes, effect sizes, between-study heterogeneity, and evidence composition. We then use case studies based on existing NMA works to illustrate the practical application of our methods. Our results suggest that normally powers are sensitive to the strength of evidence and can be improved by increasing sample sizes, reducing between-study heterogeneity, and having more direct evidence. These traits are shown to be consistent under both discrete and continuous outcomes. We also demonstrate that although power behaviors of contrast-based and arm-based NMA methods largely agree, they can differ when the strength of evidence is weak. The findings provide insights into the empirical implications of power analysis in NMA, which helps practitioners more efficiently design and assess NMA studies.
