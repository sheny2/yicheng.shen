Understanding the residual behaviors has always been a key challenge for analysts who need to examine the validity of fitted models. In the framework of linear mixedeffects (LME) models, we employ simulation-based methods that provide an abundant set of artificial data and models with and without deficiencies to explore the finitesample behavior of residual diagnostics. The results of our simulations point to the intertwined nature of LME model assumptions: a single or a pair of misspecifications often lead to structures in residual plots that could be flagged as problematic to other assumptions. The way in which the hierarchical data was composed, namely cluster sizes, residual variances, and longitudinal settings, are all influential to the residual diagnostics. These findings have major implications for the LME model checking procedures using residual analysis and can serve as guidelines for interpreting residual diagnostic plots and test statistics.
