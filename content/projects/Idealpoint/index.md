The analysis of online network interactions on social media platforms has become a popular technique for evaluating ideological orientations and dispositions of their users. Ideal points, in particular, are often the quantities of interest to social scientists by measuring individualsâ€™ policy preferences usually within a spatial framework. We first demonstrate that the standard approaches are inconsistent over time by studying the networks of the same group of political elites and regular Twitter users from 2017 to 2022. To address this issue and to improve the overall quality of ideological estimates, we propose to augment the network data that is used for ideal point estimation of an individual with rich text data that is commonly available in social network contexts. Our results indicate that this adjustment could help better identify the extreme ends on the ideology spectrum and highlight these elites through their political languages. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the political landscape on social media in democratic politics as well as more reliable methodologies for comprehending this complex terrain.
