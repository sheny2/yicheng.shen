COVID-19 has become an urgent national crisis and fast spreading pandemic throughout the United States in the first half of 2020, with millions of rapidly growing infections in all 50 states. Despite efforts to understand the disease and ameliorate the situation, the over- whelming challenge ahead, however, has put great pressures on the medical system and also limited scientistsâ€™ ability to gather comprehensive data and conduct timely statistical analysis. In order to compute related probabilities of different stages of the disease transmission based on a causal graph, we introduce the belief propagation algorithm to the attainable epidemiological data set. With the resulting probability set and clique marginals, short-turn predictions by absorbing evidence from special cases are realized. Based on our analysis, we advise stricter government implementation of health regulations and continuous practice of social distancing in order to address the pandemic in the near future.
